Replit Agent Task: Add “Free Resources” page + nav link (DO NOT TOUCH anything else)

IMPORTANT RULES
- Do not change, refactor, restyle, or move any existing sections/components/pages.
- Do not edit the homepage content, the Download page, or any current routes/components except what is strictly necessary to add ONE new nav link and ONE new page.
- Only add:
  1) A new navigation link labeled “Free Resources” placed next to “Download”
  2) A new page route: /free-resources
- Keep all existing styling, layout, and behavior unchanged.

CONTEXT
- We already have a Mailchimp landing page for the freebie signup (I will upload the landing page screenshot/file so you can align tone and messaging).
- This new /free-resources page is a dedicated hub for freebies now and in the future.
- The page should not repeat the Mailchimp landing page copy. Keep it short and non-redundant.
- The main CTA on /free-resources should link out to the Mailchimp landing page (use a placeholder URL for now if you don’t have it yet, I will provide it).

DELIVERABLES
1) Add nav item:
   - Label: “Free Resources”
   - Placement: in the top navigation next to “Download”
   - Links to: /free-resources

2) Create new page:
   - Route: /free-resources
   - Title/H1: “Free Resources”
   - Purpose: quick overview + link to current freebie + space for future freebies

PAGE CONTENT (short, non-redundant)
Above the fold:
- H1: Free Resources
- Short intro paragraph (2–3 lines max):
  “A small library of free printables and tools for Aussie families. Download our current bundle and check back as we add more.”

Current freebie section:
- Section title: “Current Freebie”
- Name: “School & Kids Activity Bundle”
- 1–2 sentence description:
  “Term planner, kids activity pack, screen-free ideas, plus a bonus 20-page activity book.”
- CTA button: “Get the free bundle”
- Button link: MAILCHIMP_LANDING_PAGE_URL (use placeholder if missing)

Important note (small text under CTA):
- “After signing up, check Spam or Promotions if you don’t see the email.”

Digital disclaimer (small, not heavy):
- “Digital download only. Print at home (A4 or any size) for personal use.”
- “Printed copies are available on request. Printing charges and shipping costs apply.”

Future freebies (simple placeholder section):
- Section title: “More coming soon”
- Copy:
  “We’ll add new freebies here over time. Check back soon.”

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Reuse existing site components/styles (buttons, headings, spacing) so it looks native.
- Do not add new global CSS or change theme variables.
- Only add the minimal code needed: a new page component + a single new nav link.
- Provide a brief summary of files changed and where the new route is registered.

After implementing, confirm:
- Existing pages look identical as before
- Only change visible to users is the new “Free Resources” nav link and the new /free-resources page
