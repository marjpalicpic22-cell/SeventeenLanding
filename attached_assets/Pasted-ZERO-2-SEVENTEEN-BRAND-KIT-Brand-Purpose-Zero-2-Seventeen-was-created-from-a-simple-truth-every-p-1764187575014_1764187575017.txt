ZERO 2 SEVENTEEN BRAND KIT
 Brand Purpose
Zero 2 Seventeen was created from a simple truth every parent feels
children grow quickly, and the things they need grow even quicker.
We believe families shouldn’t have to stretch themselves thin buying things that will only be used for a moment and that perfectly good items shouldn’t be thrown away when they still have life left in them.
Our purpose is to make second-hand feel natural, easy, and meaningful.
To help families support one another, lighten the financial load, and reduce waste without judgment or stress. Because when one family is finished with something, there’s almost always another family who truly needs it.
We’re here to bring those families together simply, safely, and with heart.
Brand Story “Who We Are”
Where our story begins
Zero 2 Seventeen started the same way so many family ideas begin in the middle of real life.
Madelon was searching for a highchair for little Liliana. Something safe. Something affordable. Something that made sense for a baby who’d outgrow it in no time.
But every option came with frustration:
overpriced new items, unreliable second-hand sellers, confusing listings, no-shows, and experiences that just didn’t feel safe.
One afternoon, after yet another failed attempt, she said, “There has to be an easier way.”
And that moment sparked everything.
Why we built Zero 2 Seventeen
We wanted a place where families could pass things on without stress.
A place where you could trust the listings, trust the people, and trust the process.
A place built on care not chaos.
We imagined a community where:
parents help parents
items stay in use, not in landfill
giving feels just as easy as selling
and buying second-hand feels normal, not like a compromise
What started with one highchair has grown into a movement built around connection, kindness, and shared values.
Zero 2 Seventeen was created by parents who understand the highs and lows of raising children and it exists for every family who wants a smarter, kinder way to buy, sell, donate, and recycle.
Our Mission
Our mission is to build a global circular economy for children’s items one that keeps good things in use, lightens the load on families, and protects the world our children will inherit.
We want every family, everywhere, to have access to quality items without financial strain, without waste, and without difficulty.
Our Values
 Sustainability
We give every item a longer life. By keeping children’s goods in circulation, we reduce waste and lighten our footprint on the earth.
Family
Everything we create begins with the question:
“Would we feel good about this for our own family?”
If not, we don’t do it.
Community
Families thrive when they support one another.
Our platform makes that connection simple, safe, and natural.
Giving Back
Selling helps your household.
Donating helps someone else’s.
Recycling helps the planet.
Every action matters.
Education
We’re raising a generation that understands reuse, responsibility, and the importance of caring for the world they’ll grow up in.


Our Vision
We imagine a world where second-hand isn’t second choice it’s simply how families live.
A world where:
parents save money without worry
communities share more and waste less
items are passed along with purpose
and families feel connected rather than isolated
We’re starting in Australia and the United States, expanding to the UK, and building toward a global network of families helping families.
This isn’t just an app it’s a lasting legacy of care.
